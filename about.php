        Welcome to Storm Peak Lodging!  We are located on the outskirts of Silverton, Colorado at the base of Storm Peak.  When you are ready to get away
        from the busy city, we offer a place where you can truly rest like the gods of ages past.

        We were established in 2005 when the owner Stormy Jackson was visiting Silverton during a getaway from his busy job in web development.  He wanted to
        get away and disconnnect from the technological world, so he started hiking the area for the best spots to relax.  During one breakfast in a local
        diner, he overheard talk of the legendary Storm Peak to the north.  Compared often to Zeus' home away from Mount Olympus, Stormy had to see how far
        he could climb.

        Stormy was not an experienced mountain climber, but he set out that morning after breakfast with only his backpack.  It took him two days to reach
        as far as he could go, but all was not lost as the spot was also a fantastic overlook to the other nearby peaks.  He spent some time in isolation on
        that place relaxing and communing with nature before he started heading back before as he says "The gathering storm on the mountain could get me!"

        At Storm Peak Lodging, we have rustic timber cabins and a huge fireplace in the main room to relax and socialize with other guests.  The lush surroundings
        of firs, pines, and spruce trees create an atmosphere straight out of a postcard. While staying with us, you can expect to see some friendly visitors. Deer
        and elk are known to roam the grounds trying to sneak into our esteemed restaurant, the Stormy Peak Dining Room. The restaurant has been featured as a 2015
        Dinerâ€™s Choice and was awarded a Gold rating. The mountain-themed menu is filled with bison burgers, spiced free-range chicken, and our famous buffalo bear
        ribs!  All of this accompanied by locally grown vegetables, herbs, spices, and our mountain themed deserts.

        Storm Peak Lodging is the perfect all-season lodge. We are right next to some of the best skiing in the world, and during fall it is a short trip to see
        some of the most gorgeous autumn foliage found in the mountains.  Storm Peak looms in the distance, and many of our rooms face this majestic marvel allowing
        you to potentially get a look at the ever elusive god on the mountain.  We offer rooms in the main building, and many cabins on the property spaced out far
        enough apart for those who wish to have the silence of nature around them.  And, our founder Stormy Jackson is a regular on the property talking to visitors
        and guests about his mountain adventures and tending to guest's needs!  Come and vist us today, just watch out for those storms!
